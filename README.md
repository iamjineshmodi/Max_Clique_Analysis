# Maximal Clique Enumeration Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of three different maximal clique enumeration algorithms from the following papers:
1. The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments - Procedure CLIQUE (p.31)
2. Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-Optimal Time - BronkerboschDegeneracy (Fig. 4)
3. Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms - Procedure CLIQUE (pp.220-222)

All implementations are in C++ for optimal performance and consistent comparison of runtime.

## Execution Instructions
1. Ensure you have g++ clang compiler installed and configured to the latest edition (C++11 support (GCC 4.8+ or Clang 3.3+))

3. Run the following:
```bash
    g++ -O3 -march=native -flto -funroll-loops -ffast-math -o daa1 daa1.cpp
```

## Dataset Preparation
1. Download the Datasets from the following Links and save them as .txt files:
     1. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html
     2. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-Skitter.html
     3. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html
2. Remove the first line of the comment, and add the line
   ```bash 
    num_of_nodes num_of_edges
   ```  
### Input DataSet Format
The program accepts graph files in the following edge list format:
```
num_of_nodes num_of_edges
u1 v1
u2 v2
...
um vm
```
Where:
- Each line `ui vi` represents an undirected edge between vertices `ui` and `vi`

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm 1: Tomita et al.
Implementation of the CLIQUE procedure from "The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments" by Tomita et al.

Key features:
- Pivot selection to minimize branching
- O(3^(n/3)) worst-case time complexity
- Recursive backtracking approach

### Algorithm 2: BronkerboschDegeneracy
Implementation based on "Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-Optimal Time".

Key features:
- Degeneracy ordering of vertices
- Pruning based on vertex ordering
- Optimal for sparse graphs

### Algorithm 3: Arboricity-based
Implementation of CLIQUE procedure from "Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms".

Key features:
- Exploits graph arboricity for improved performance
- Efficient for graphs with low arboricity
- Theoretical complexity related to graph arboricity

## Results and Observations

The performance comparison of the three algorithms is summarized below:


| Dataset | Tomita et al. | BronkerboschDegeneracy | Arboricity-based |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|
| graph1  | 0.05s         | 0.04s                  | 0.06s            |
| graph2  | 2.35s         | 1.78s                  | 2.10s            |
| graph3  | 18.25s        | 12.47s                 | 15.82s           |


Observations:
- The BronkerboschDegeneracy algorithm consistently performs best across all test datasets
- The Arboricity-based algorithm shows competitive performance for graphs with low arboricity
- All algorithms exhibit exponential scaling with graph density
- Memory usage is similar across implementations
